Your claim has been given our careful attention, and its investigation has been completed.

A copy of the delivery receipt is included with this letter. Please note that the shipment was
delivered without notation of apparent damage. This is considered evidence that the goods
were delivered in the same condition as received.

Furthermore, we note that item 300135 of the National Motor Freight Classification requires
that a carrier be notified within 5 business days of delivery of concealed damage. In absence
of this timely notification, the claimant must provide reasonable proof that the damage was not
incurred by the consignee after delivery of shipment by carrier.

This shipment was delivered on 10/10/2018. This claim was received on 11/6/2018, some 20
days after delivery, and proof of responsibility for the damage is not offered.

As a result of this apparent clear delivery and the lack of timely notification of concealed
damage, this claim must respectfully be declined.
